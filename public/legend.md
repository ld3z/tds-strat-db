# FAQ:

## 1. Why is my strategy not listed here?

This project is a one person team and strategies have to be manually added to the ```strategies.json``` file in the repository.

## 2. Why are there difficulties on the strategies?

- The difficulties and colors are representative of the map that the strategy was made for (i.e if the strat uses Wrecked Battlefield, then it is a *Normal* map) therefore, the strat gets a *Normal* difficulty next to it.

- If a strategy has two or more maps assigned to it, then the strategy card will reflect that

## 3. What does the *star* mean next to a strategy?

It means that the strategy is recommended to use.

## 4. "There's an eye next to the strategy!"

Don't be alarmed, it's just telling you that the strategy has a linked youtube video of point of views for player(s), and can be helpful to figuring out either what went wrong or something that they did.
