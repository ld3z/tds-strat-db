# FAQ:

## 1. Why is my strategy not listed here?

This project is a one-person team, and strategies have to be manually added to the site *until I decide to DB it*.

## 2. Why are there difficulties with the strategies?

- The difficulties and colors are representative of the map that the strategy was made for (i.e., if the strat uses Wrecked Battlefield, then it is a *Normal* map); therefore, the strat gets a *Normal* difficulty next to it.

- If a strategy has two or more maps assigned to it, then the strategy card will reflect that

## 3. What does the *star* mean next to a strategy?

It means that the strategy is recommended to use.

## 4. "There's an eye next to the strategy!"

Don't be alarmed; it's just telling you that the strategy has a linked YouTube video(s) regarding points of view for player(s) and can be helpful to figuring out either what went wrong or something that they did.

## 5. "Why is the date not correct?"

The dates posted on each strategy are the dates that the strategy was indexed by the site, not the actual day that the strategy was created.
